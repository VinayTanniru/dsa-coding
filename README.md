# DSA Learning in Java

## Overview
This repository is for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and implementing them in **Java**.  
The goal is to **practice each concept, understand it deeply, and track progress**.  

> ⚠️ All topics are a **work in progress**. New implementations will be added gradually.

## Structure
DSA-Learning-Java/
├── src/main/java/algorithms/ # Java implementations (work in progress)
├── README.md # This file
└── .gitignore # Ignored files

## Topics (Planned / Work in Progress)
- **Basics:** Arrays, Strings, Recursion  
- **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- **Data Structures:** Stack, Queue, Linked List, HashMap, Heap  
- **Trees:** Binary Trees, BST, Traversals  
- **Graphs:** BFS, DFS, Shortest Path  
- **Advanced:** Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking  

> Note: Some topics are implemented; others are in progress.

## Approach
1. Learn the concept  
2. Implement in Java  
3. Test with examples  
4. Commit with clear messages
